Have you heard the news about how ChatGPT, the AI language model trained by OpenAI, passed the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE)? As someone who is passionate about both artificial intelligence and medicine, I was fascinated by this achievement and wondered if ChatGPT could do more than just pass the exam.

This led me to embark on a project to see if I could use ChatGPT's capabilities to create new questions for the USMLE. Specifically, I wanted to see if the language model could generate USMLE-style questions on the cardiovascular system, one of the most important topics in medical education.

To achieve this, I fine-tuned the model to understand the format and structure of USMLE questions. The process involved training the model on a large corpus of USMLE questions and answers, enabling it to understand the key components of a USMLE-style question, such as the stem, the answer choices, and the distractors.

After fine-tuning the model, I asked ChatGPT to generate 100 questions on the cardiovascular system. The results were impressive, covering a wide range of topics from the anatomy and physiology of the heart to the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

To showcase the potential of these generated questions, I created a quiz app that medical students and physicians could use to test their knowledge of the cardiovascular system. The app featured multiple-choice questions with answer explanations and provided users with immediate feedback on their performance.

By using AI-generated questions, the quiz app was able to provide a large number of challenging questions that covered various aspects of the cardiovascular system. This allowed medical students and physicians to test their knowledge in a fun and engaging way and helped them prepare for the USMLE and other medical exams.

My experience with generating USMLE-style questions has shown the potential of AI in the medical field. By leveraging the power of language models like ChatGPT, we can create new and innovative tools to help medical students and physicians prepare for exams and enhance their medical knowledge.

In conclusion, AI-generated questions offer a promising new approach to medical education and exam preparation. As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see more applications of AI in the medical field, offering new ways to improve healthcare and medical education.

If you're interested in testing your knowledge of the cardiovascular system or preparing for the USMLE, you can check out the quiz app that I created using the AI-generated questions. The app is available [here](https://med-learning.web.app/#/). I hope you find it useful and informative!
